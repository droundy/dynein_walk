Figures to make, all using the same style, which explain stuff about the dyn

1.0.0 Interest builder: The three motor proteins (maybe doing their walks). Purpose: to show that dynein has a weird separation between its motor and foot domains. Show where energy is used in each motor.

1.2.6 Why is dynein special and interesting?: Figure comparing the crystal structures of kinesin and dynein together. This figure can hilight the ATP hydrolysis, linker and MTBD amino acids.

2.1.1 A crystal structure of dynein along with our model, showing exactly how the domains match up with the balls/sticks

2.1.3/4 A crystal structure of dynein along with the angular springs model, showing the elastic regions in dynein (when making this, pay attention to the
tail region to see how much our approximation makes sense)
