  notes={A one-dimensional model which tracks the position of cargo, tail, heads and MTBDs. It doesn't take into account y, only x. Uses springy rods, not springy angles. This model is winch-like in that it doesn't allow its stalk or tail angles to change, which is a weakness. It is also a pro-winch model. They also have predetermined binding sites, which is an advantage of our model. The model domains are effectively projeted into 1D, which is unphysical. They use a weird dashpot-spring force mechanism to force steps, which seems very unphysical. We allow stepping to happen naturally, whereas they force the model to step a certain length. Also makes assumptions about stepping order in a wird way, doesn't do tension-gating. Doesn't have any bothbound dynamics, which make up most of the dynamics of dynein, according to our theory. Their unbinding rates don't take into account conformational information or tension-gating, whereas ours do. No brownian forces. No conformational changes, very artificial foot movement. Main issues: lack of any biophysical step mechanism, no Brownian dynamics, 1D, assumes winch model.}

  notes={MD simulation which simulates both the prestroke and powerstroke. They seem to happen pretty quick. Doesn't simulate the dimer, which would be cool to actually see the powerstroke happen. This could confirm if the winch or powerstroke pictures are true. They show that potentially the MTBD is in the low-affinity state when the linker powerstroke happens, which conflicts with the Cianfrocco model. In light of their finding that the linker powerstroke occurs before the MTBD low->high transition, they present a model (the winch model?) where the powerstroke occurs when the MTBD is in a low-affinity mode (MT unbound?) and the head somehow rotates/translates, which somehow causes the head to diffuse forward and rebind MT, going into the high-affinity state. This seems winch-like. It would be nice to test if our model could display this behavior by adding new states and changing the transition order.}
