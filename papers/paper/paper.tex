\dropcap{D}ynein is a motor protein used to generate directed force in cells. The protein is a homodimer which binds to cellular filaments known as microtubules (MTs). Each monomer has several ATPase domains arranged in a larger globular domain known as the ``head''. This head is the site which hydrolyzes ATP and undergoes the conformational changes responsible for dynein's step. The head is attached via a long chain to the microtubule binding domain (MTBD). Dynein is an interesting structure in that it manages to coordinate ATPase chemistry at its head with MT-releasing chemistry at its MTBD, some 20nm away \cite{mt-atp-coupling}. The head has a long tail domain coming off it, which eventually dimerizes to the other monomer.\\

Dynein is unique in that it has a widely varied step size. Dynein's average step is 8 \textit{nm} in the forwards direction, but it is capable of taking 32 \textit{nm} steps in the forwards and reverse directions \cite{weihongpaper} \cite{yildizpaper}. This stochastic, varied stepping is contrasted with the much more regular 8 \textit{nm} step size of kinesin, another bipedal motor protein \cite{kinesin-step-size}. It has been suggested that the long separation between dynein's MTBD and dimerization sites facilitates larger diffusive searches, allowing dynein to take larger steps than kinesin \cite{cargotransport}.\\

A simple explanation for dynein's stepping pattern can be given based on only a few facts about the protein. It is known that on treatment with ATP, the tail-head-MTBD angle of a dynein monomer alters, moving the MTBD closer to the tail \cite{carteradpprimed} \cite{burgess-paper}. It is also known that the nucleotide state of the head communicates with the MTBD. ATP binding at a head ATPase shifts the MTBD from a strong to weak MT-bound state. And vice-versa, whether the MTBD is bound or unbound from the MT changes the ATPase rate at the head. From this it is possible to infer a simple model for the dynein stepping cycle. This model, known as the mechanochemical cycle \cite{cianfroccoreview}, has dynein unbind MT, kick forward, diffuse to the next MT binding site, rebind MT, then repeat. Whether a model this simple can explain dynein's behavior needs to be tested.\\

There are many relevant details about dynein which this simple model doesn't account for. Dynein is known to have low interhead communication at low separation, but to have a tension-gated stepping pattern at high separations \cite{yildizpaper}. It is also suggested that dynein's MTBD doesn't conduct an undirected search for its next MT binding site, but rather is guided by long-range electrostatic interactions from each MT binding site \cite{longrangemt}. Dynein has several cofactors which alter its dynamics. For example, the motor's stall force is tripled when exposed to dynactin and Bic2D \cite{yildizdynactin}. This is odd, since the dynactin- and Bic2D-binding site on dynein is on the tail, far from the motor heads. Many of these details suggest a complicated picture of dynein motility than a simple forward kick and pull mechanism.\\

Several computational models have been created to explain dynein's motility. \textit{Imamula et. al.} define a chemical transition model which defines all the MT- and nucleotide-bound states dynein goes through as it walks \cite{imamulamodel}. \textit{Sarlah et. al} simulate a model obeying rate constants from \textit{Imamula}, and replicate dynein's stepping trajectory \cite{sarlahmodel}. \textit{Zheng} uses normal mode analysis to simulate the dynein motor's transition from pre to post-powerstroke \cite{normalmodes}. To our knowledge, no computational model exists which takes into account the microscopic dynamics of protein-water interactions to test whether diffusion is enough for dynein motility. Here we show how a simple Brownian dynamics model can be used to test the mechanochemical cycle picture of dynein processivity.\\

\section{Model}
This dynein model is meant to capture the coarse-grained structural, dynamical and chemical properties of the full dynein complex while remaining mathematically simple. The structural features of dynein are captured through a two-dimensional geometric model of circular domains connected by rigid rods, shown in Figure \ref{fig:model}. The dynamics of dynein are captured by imposing both equilibrium and Brownian forces on each circular domain of the model. The chemical properties of dynein are captured by sporadically transitioning the model between two states: a ``bothbound'' state where both binding domains are fixed to the microtubule, and a ``onebound'' state where one foot is free to diffuse. Each state feels equilibrium forces meant to mimic the structural changes which occur through dynein's chemical cycle. This transitioning is meant to capture the powerstroke of dynein, between the apo ``post-powerstroke'' state and the ADP-Pi-bound ``pre-powerstroke'' state.

\subsection*{Model geometry}
The dynein model represents a full dynein complex consisting of two dynein heavy chains dimerized by a large tail domain. The model accounts for the following domains within the complex: two microtubule binding domains (``MTBD''), two AAA+ heptad motor domains, and a tail domain consisting of many dynein light chains and a dimerization site. MTBDs, motor domains and the tail are all represented by circles of radius $R_b$, $R_m$ and $R_t$, respectively. Each MTBD is connected to a motor domain via a rigid rod of length $L_s$, meant to represent the stalk domain. Each motor domain is connected to the tail domain via a rigid rod of length $L_t$; this rod represents the heavy chain linker and intermediate/light chains which connect the motor to the dimerization site.\\

Values for $R$ and $L$ were acquired by aligning the dynein model with EM micrographs of the full dynein complex \cite{burgess-paper,grotjahn}, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:micrographs}. See Table \ref{table:params} for these values.\\

\subsection*{Equilibrium forces}
The onebound model has four degrees of freedom: $\theta_{bb}, \theta_{bm}, \theta_{um}$ and $\theta_{ub}$. The bothbound model has two: $\theta_{nm}$ and $\theta_{fm}$. The model is free to vary across all of these degrees of freedom, barring steric interactions with the microtubule. These angles describe a planar model which is not capable of transverse motion. To capture the gross dynamics and interdomain oscillations of the protein, restoring forces are imposed on each angle about equilibrium angles $\theta^{eq}_{bb}, \theta^{eq}_{bm}, \theta^{eq}_{um}, \theta^{eq}_{ub}$ for onebound and $\theta^{eq}_{nm}$ and $\theta^{eq}_{fm}$ for bothbound. Each domain $i$ has a harmonic energy $c_i\left(\theta_i-\theta^{eq}_i\right)^2$ which exerts a restoring force pushing it back to equilibrium, where $c_b$, $c_m$ and $c_t$ are spring constants for each domain. These equilibrium angles are taken to be the average angle occupied by the protein in solution, and are thus extracted from EM micrographs, shown in Figure \ref{fig:micrographs}. Electron microscopy studies using ADP-Vi to freeze dynein in the pre-powerstroke state allow for both pre- and post-stroke equilibrium angles to be found \cite{burgess-paper}.\\

\subsection*{Brownian dynamics}
Brownian dynamics is used to study the model's dynamics in a biophysical manner. In the Brownian regime, protein motion is given by $\dot{\vec{X}} = \frac{1}{\gamma}\left(\vec{F}+\vec{R}\right)$. In the model, each circular domain has its own associated $\gamma$ factor given by Stokes' Law as $\gamma_i = 6\pi\nu R_i$ with dynamic viscosity $\nu$ \cite{stokeslaw}. The force on each domain is given by $\vec{F} = \vec{F}_{spr} + \vec{T}$, where $\vec{T}$ is the tension force between domains maintaining the rigid rod constraint. Each domain feels not only a harmonic restoring force, but also a Brownian force $\vec{R}$. This force is a Gaussian-distributed zero-mean magnitude with variance $R_{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{\frac{2k_bT\gamma}{\delta t}}$ \cite{einstein} and uniformly random direction.

\subsection*{Binding}
Conformational changes on nucleotide binding, also known as the mechanochemical cycle \cite{cianfrocco}, are captured by transitioning the model between the onebound and bothbound states. Binding can occur when the onebound model's unbound foot diffuses near enough the microtubule. When within a distance of $1 A$, binding occurs at a rate of $k_b$ (Table \ref{table:params}). On binding, the onebound model changes state to a bothbound model while retaining the positions of its domains. The previously unbound domain is transported to the microtubule.

\subsection*{Unbinding}
Unbinding occurs when a bothbound MTBD unbinds from the microtubule. This event can occur for either MTBD, and each domain has its own unbinding rate $k_{ub}$. To account for the tension-gating proposed by Yildiz \textit{et al} \cite{yildiz} to allow for interhead communication and bias the motor forward, the parameter $c$ is used to alter the unbinding rates of either MTBD. For domain $i \in \{n, f\}$ with binding domain angle $\theta_{ib}\left(\theta_{nm}, \theta_{fm}\right)$, unbinding rate is given by $k_{ub} = k^0_{ub}e^{-c\left(\theta_{ib}-\theta^{eq}_{ib}\right)}$. This will bias the model to unbind more preferentially for the lagging MTBD due to a higher likelihood for $\theta^{eq}_{ib} > \theta_{ib}$ for the lagging head. Values used for parameters $k^0_{ub}$ and $c$, along with $k_b$, are shown in Table \ref{table:params}.\\

The ``prestroke'' and ``powerstroke'' events in the mechanochemical cycle \cite{cianfrocco} are captured by different motor equilibrium angles between the onebound and bothbound states. The onebound ``prestroke'' state has an unbound motor angle closer to $\pi$ than the bothbound motor\cite{burgess-paper}; thus, on unbinding, the unbound MTBD should experience a restoring force effecting the ``prestroke'' conformational change. On rebinding, the motors transition back to the poststroke equilibrium, producing restoring forces in the direction of the ``powerstroke.''

  \section*{Fitting $k_b$ and $k_{ub}$}
  To fit the binding and unbinding rate constants $k^0_b$ and $k^0_{ub}$, a simple theoretical model for stepping was used. First, it is assumed that the unbinding rate of an MTBD does not depend on the binding state of the other MTBD. Then the dissociation rate of the whole complex from the microtubule, $k_{dis}$, is estimated as $k_{dis} = P(ob)*k_{ub} = \frac{\bar{t}_{ob}}{\bar{t}_{step}} * \frac{1}{\bar{t}_{bb}}$, where $P(ob)$ is the probability of a dynein complex being in the onebound state, $\bar{t}_{ob}$ and $\bar{t}_{bb}$ are the expected durations for a onebound and bothbound state, and $\bar{t}_{step} = \bar{t}_{ob} + \bar{t}_{bb}$ is the expected step duration. Plugging in the last definition yields $k_{dis} = \frac{\bar{t}_{step} - \bar{t}_{bb}}{\bar{t}_{step}\bar{t}_{bb}}$. Introducing a new variable $\bar{t}_{run}$, the average run length of in vivo dynein, and using the relation $\bar{t}_{run} = k_{dis}^{-1}$, a new relation is found for bothbound time: $\bar{t}_{bb} = \frac{\bar{t}_{run}\bar{t}_{step}}{\bar{t}_{run}+\bar{t}_{step}}$. Using the definition of $\bar{t}_{step}$ a similar relation is found for onebound time: $\bar{t}_{ob} = \frac{\bar{t}_{step}^2}{\bar{t}_{step}+\bar{t}_{run}}$. Finally, using the relation $\bar{t}_{step} = \frac{v}{L_{step}}$ for dynein velocity $v$ and expected step length $\bar{L}_{step}$, the following equations are found for onebound and bothbound time in terms of experimental observables of velocity, run time and step length:

  \begin{align}
    \bar{t}_{ob} &= \frac{v^2}{\bar{L}_{step}^2\left(v/\bar{L}_{step}+\bar{t}_{run}\right)}\\
    \bar{t}_{bb} &= \frac{v\bar{t}_{run}}{\bar{L}_{step}\left(\bar{t}_{run}+v/\bar{L}_{step}\right)}
  \end{align}

  \section*{Onebound motion equations derivation}
  Brownian Dynamics was used to describe the motion of each domain, indexing with $i \in \{bb, bm, t, um, ub\}$, corresponding to bound-binding, bound-motor, tail, unbound-motor, unbound-binding:

  \begin{align}
    \dot{X_i} &= \frac{1}{\gamma_i}\left(F^x_i + R^x_i\right)\\
    \dot{Y_i} &= \frac{1}{\gamma_i}\left(F^y_i + R^y_i\right)
  \end{align}

  where $F^{x/y}_i$ is the force projection on coordinate $x/y$ of domain $i$, and $R^x_i$ the Brownian force, a Gaussian zero-mean force with variance $R_{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{\frac{2k_bT\gamma}{\delta t}}$ \cite{einstein}. Transforming position variables to polar coordinates results in four degrees of freedom: $\theta_{bb}, \theta_{bm}, \theta_{um} and \theta_{ub}$. Performing this transformation and expanding the force term yields the following equations:

  \begin{multline}
    \dot{X_i}\left(\theta_{bb}, ..., \theta_{ub}, \dot{\theta}_{bb}, ..., \dot{\theta}_{ub}\right) = \frac{1}{\gamma_i}\big(F^{spr}_x(\theta_{bb}, ..., \theta_{ub}) + \\
    \lambda_i\left(X_{i+1}-X_i\right) + \lambda_{i-1}\left(X_i-X_{i-1}\right)R^x_i\big)
    \label{eq:ob-system}
  \end{multline}

  \begin{multline}
    \dot{Y_i}\left(\theta_{bb}, ..., \theta_{ub}, \dot{\theta}_{bb}, ..., \dot{\theta}_{ub}\right) = \frac{1}{\gamma_i}\big(F^{spr}_y(\theta_{bb}, ..., \theta_{ub}) + \\
    \lambda_i\left(Y_{i+1}-Y_i\right) + \lambda_{i-1}\left(Y_i-Y_{i-1}\right)R^y_i\big)
    \label{eq:ob-system}
  \end{multline}

  where the $\lambda$ terms are tension terms needed to maintain the rigid rod constraints and $\vec{F}^{spr}$ the harmonic equilibrium forces felt by each domain. Each $X_i$ coordinate is related to the $\theta_j$ coordinates via the recursive formulas $X_{i>1} = L_i\cos(\theta_{i-1})+X_{i-1}$ and $Y_{i>1} = L_i\sin(\theta_{i-1})+Y_{i-1}$ for y-coords. Thus, each $\dot{X_i}$ term is linearly related to one or more $\dot{\theta_j}$ terms.\\

  There are $n$ unknown $\theta_j$ values and n unknown $\lambda$ values, totaling $2n$ unknown variables. There are $2n$ equations linear in $\dot{theta_j}$ and $\lambda_q$, $n$ each from the X and Y equations. The system of equations provided by Equation $\ref{eq:ob-system}$ was solved in Matlab, yielding equations for all $\dot{\theta_j}$.

  \section*{Bothbound motion equations derivation}
  Brownian dynamics was also used for the bothbound case. Due to the added constraint of both binding domains being fixed to the microtubule, the model is fully described by angles $\theta_{nm}$ and $\theta_{fm}$; see Figure \ref{fig:model}. The positions of non-bound domains are defined by the following equation for $i \in \{nb, nm, t, fm, fb\}$, corresponding to near-binding, near-motor, tail, far-motor and far-binding domains:

  \begin{multline}
    \dot{X_{i\neq\{nb, fb\}}}\left(\theta_{nm},\theta_{fm}, \dot{\theta_{nm}}, \dot{\theta_{fm}}\right) = \frac{1}{\gamma_i}\big(F^{spr}_x(\theta_{nm}, \theta_{fm}) + \\
    \lambda_i\left(X_{i+1}-X_i\right) + \lambda_{i-1}\left(X_i-X_{i-1}\right) + R^x_i\big)
    \label{eq:bb-system}
  \end{multline}

  \begin{multline}
    \dot{Y_{i\neq\{nb, fb\}}}\left(\theta_{nm},\theta_{fm}, \dot{\theta_{nm}}, \dot{\theta_{fm}}\right) = \frac{1}{\gamma_i}\big(F^{spr}_y(\theta_{nm}, \theta_{fm}) + \\
    \lambda_i\left(Y_{i+1}-Y_i\right) + \lambda_{i-1}\left(Y_i-Y_{i-1}\right) + R^y_i\big)
    \label{eq:bb-system}
  \end{multline}

  Coordinate velocities are similarly linear with $\dot{\theta_{nm}}$ and $\dot{\theta_{fm}}$. This system has six independent equations and six unknowns $\dot{\theta_{nm}}, \dot{\theta_{fm}}, \lambda_{nb}, \lambda_{nm}, \lambda_{t}, \lambda_{fm}$. Analytic solutions were acquired using Mathematica.

  \section*{Simulating the model}
  Simulations began in the bothbound equilibrium state. The model was time-evolved via Euler's Method using analytic expressions for $\{\dot{\theta}_{bb}, \dot{\theta}_{bm}, \dot{\theta}_{um}, \dot{\theta}_{ub}\}$, using a timestep of $dt = 10^{-10}s$. In the onebound state, during each timestep the model had a $k_b*dt$ probability of transitioning into the bothbound state, where $k_b = k_b^0\left(1-H\left(X_{uby}-0.1\right)\right)$, where H is the Heaviside function. On transition to bothbound, proper $\theta_{nm}$ and $\theta_{fm}$ angles and proper interhead separation $L$ were calculated to yield a bothbound model with identical cartesian positions to the old bothbound, except with the previously unbound binding domain moved to $y=0$. Once in bothbound, the model was time-evolved via Euler's Method using analytic expressions for $\{\dot{\theta}_{nm}$ and $\dot{\theta}_{fm}\}$ and a timestep of $dt=10^{-10}s$. Each timestep, the bothbound model had a $k_{ub}*dt$ chance of transitioning to onebound, where $k_{ub} = k^0_{ub}e^{-c(\theta-\theta_{eq})}$. On transitioning, proper values of $\{\theta_{bb}, \theta_{bm}, \theta_{um}, \theta_{ub}\}$ were calculated to create a onebound model with identical cartesian positions to the old bothbound model.\\

\end{figure}

\textbf{Processive, forward-directed motility}\\
The model was time-evolved using Euler's method. When simulated, the model produces processive, forward-directed motion. Figure \ref{fig:trajectory} shows a short time window of the model's dynamics. The model is capable of taking both forward and backwards steps, but is biased in the forward direction.\\

\textbf{Stepping dynamics}
The stepping dynamics of the model reproduce experimental results. The model is capable of producing a wide variety of step lengths, from 48nm forward to 40nm backwards, as in Figure \ref{fig:behavior}.a. The onebound and bothbound times correspond well to the theoretical values, as in \ref{fig:behavior}.b and c. The tension-gating mechanism is capable of producing a lagging-head favor, as shown in \ref{fig:behavior}.d.

\item Consider a no-binding simulation and a separable model.  Create
  a figure demonstrating/testing whether the histogram of final
  displacement is independent of initial displacement.
\item Consider a simple Monte Carlo that just uses our no-unbinding
  and no-binding simulations to model dynein (like Yildiz).
