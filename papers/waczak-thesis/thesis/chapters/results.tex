\section{One bound and both bound correlations}
\begin{figure}[!hbt]

	\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{paper_displacement_vs_step_length}
	\caption{\textbf{Two dimensional histogram} comparing the total signed step length to
			the signed initial displacement between the binding domains. A positive value
			indicates that the front foot made the step (leading). A negative value
			indicates the rear foot (lagging) made the step. Simulations show a strong,
			negative correlation. A similar fit from an experimental paper is plotted for comparison.}
