	abstract = {Perhaps the most fascinating proteins that associate with the cytoskeleton are the molecular motors called motor proteins. These remarkable proteins bind to a polarized cytoskeletal filament and use the energy derived from repeated cycles of {ATP} hydrolysis to move steadily along it. Dozens of different motor proteins coexist in every eucaryotic cell. They differ in the type of filament they bind to (either actin or microtubules), the direction in which they move along the filament, and the “cargo” they carry. Many motor proteins carry membrane-enclosed organelles—such as mitochondria, Golgi stacks, or secretory vesicles—to their appropriate locations in the cell. Other motor proteins cause cytoskeletal filaments to slide against each other, generating the force that drives such phenomena as muscle contraction, ciliary beating, and cell division.},

Mutations in dynein or its regulators are linked to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we begin by providing a synthesis of recent data to describe the current model of dynein's mechanochemical cycle.

In contrast to other processive motors, stepping of the dynein motor domains (heads) is not precisely coordinated. Therefore, the mechanism of dynein processivity remains unclear. Here, by engineering the mechanical and catalytic properties of the motor, we show that dynein processivity minimally requires a single active head and a second inert {MT} binding domain. Processivity arises from a high ratio of {MT}-bound to unbound time, and not from interhead communication. Additionally, nucleotide-dependent microtubule release is gated by tension on the linker domain. Intramolecular tension sensing is observed in dynein’s stepping motion at high interhead separations. We developed a quantitative model for the stepping characteristics of dynein and its response to chemical and mechanical perturbation.},

	abstract = {Dynein has been examined by scanning transmission electron microscopy ({STEM}). Samples of 30S dynein from tetrahymena cilia were applied to carbon films and either were freeze- dried and examined as unstained, unfixed specimens, or were negatively stained with uranyl sulfate. A totally new image of the dynein molecule was revealed showing three globular heads connected by three separate strands to a common base. Two of the heads appeared to be identical and exhibited a diameter of 10 nm while the third head was somewhat larger (approximately 12 nm). The overall length of the particle was 35 nm. Mass analysis, based upon the integration of electron scattering intensities for unstained particles, gave a molecular weight of 1.95 (+/-)0.24) megadaltons. Mass per unit length analysis was performed using bovine brain microtubules decorated with dynein under conditions where the dynein shows a linear repeat of 24 nm with seven dynein molecules surrounding a microtubule made up of 14 protofilaments. Undecorated microtubules gave a molecular weight per unit length of 21,000+/-1,900 daltons/A, compared to a value of 84,400+/-2,200 daltons/A for the fully decorated microtubules. Taken together, these data give a molecular weight of 2.17 (+/- 0.14) megadaltons per dynein molecule, in agreement with measurements on the isolated particles. Mass analysis of individual globular heads observed in isolated particles gave a molecular weight distribution with a mean of 416+/- 76 kdaltons. These data could also be viewed as the sum of two populations of head with two-thirds of the heads at approximately 400 kdaltons and one-third at approximately 550 kdaltons, although more precise data will be required to distinguish two classes of heads with confidence. The mass of the dynein-microtubule complex as a function of distance from the midline of the particle was analysed to distinguish which end of the dynein molecule was bound to the microtubule. The projected mass distribution was consistent with a model where the three dynein heads were oriented toward the microtubule and clearly not consistent with the opposite orientation. These data indicate that the three globular heads form the {ATP}-sensitive site in this heterologous dynein-microtubule system and suggest that the rootlike base of the dynein molecule forms the structural attachment site to the A-subfiber of the outer doublet in cilia and flagella. The structure and function of the dynein are dicussed in terms of these new results.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Microtubules are tubular polymers of tubulin dimers, which are arranged head-to-tail in protofilaments that run lengthwise along the microtubules, giving them an overall structural polarity. Many of the functions of microtubules depend on this polarity, including directed intracellular transport and chromosome segregation during mitosis. The determination of microtubule polarity for lengthwise views of microtubules observed by electron microscopy has not previously been possible. Here, we present methods for directly determining the polarity of individual microtubules imaged by cryo-electron microscopy.
{RESULTS}: When observed in vitreous ice by cryo-electron microscopy, microtubules with skewed protofilaments show arrowhead moiré patterns. We have used centrosome nucleated microtubules to relate the directionality of the moiré patterns to microtubule polarity. We show that the arrowheads point towards the plus end of microtubules with protofilaments having a right-handed skew, and towards the minus end of microtubules with protofilaments having a left-handed skew. We describe two methods for determining the handedness of the protofilament skew. The first method uses two or more tilted views. The second method involves analysis of the diffraction patterns of the microtubule images.
{CONCLUSIONS}: It is now possible to determine directly the polarity of in vitro assembled microtubules from cryo-electron micrographs. This will be helpful in a number of types of studies, including studies of the three-dimensional structure of microtubules interacting with motor proteins, as knowledge of the polarity of the microtubule is essential to understand motor directionality.},

The mean displacement of dynein interacting with microtubule was {\textasciitilde}8 nm at 100 µM {ATP}, and decreased sigmoidally with a decrease in the {ATP} concentration. The {ATP} dependence of the mean displacement was explained by a model that some dynein molecules bind to microtubule in pre-stroke conformation and generate 8-nm displacement, while others bind in the post-stroke one and detach without producing a power stroke. Biochemical assays showed that the binding affinity of the post-stroke dynein to a microtubule was {\textasciitilde}5 times higher than that of pre-stroke dynein, and the dissociation rate was {\textasciitilde}4 times lower. Taking account of these rates, we conclude that the displacement driven by a power stroke is 8.3 nm. A working model of dimeric dynein driven by the 8-nm power stroke was proposed.},

Numerous experimental and theoretical efforts have been devoted to establishing how this chemomechanical coupling occurs. However, most processive motors function as dimers. Therefore a full understanding of the motor's performance also requires knowledge of the coordination between the chemomechanical cycles of the two heads. We consider a general two-headed model for cytoplasmic dynein that is built from experimental measurements on the chemomechanical states of monomeric dynein. We explore different possible scenarios of coordination that simultaneously satisfy two main requirements of the dimeric protein: high processivity (long run length) and high motor velocity (fast {ATP} turnover). To demonstrate the interplay between these requirements and the necessity for coordination, we first develop and analyze a simple mechanical model for the force-induced stepping in the absence of {ATP}. Next we use a simplified model of dimeric dynein's chemomechanical cycle to establish the kinetic rules that must be satisfied for the model to be consistent with recent data for the motor's performance from single molecule experiments. Finally, we use the results of these investigations to develop a full model for dimeric dynein's chemomechanical cycle and analyze this model to make experimentally testable predictions.},

To identify candidate proteins that mediate the Glu microtubule-vimentin interaction, we incubated microtubules with microtubule-interacting proteins and saturating levels of antibodies to Glu or tyrosinated (Tyr) tubulin. Antibodies to Glu tubulin prevented the microtubule binding of kinesin obtained from fibroblast or brain extracts more effectively than antibodies to Tyr tubulin. Scatchard plot analysis showed that kinesin heads bound to Glu microtubules with an approximately 2.8-fold higher affinity than to Tyr microtubules. Purified brain kinesin cosedimented with vimentin, but not with neurofilaments, indicating that kinesin specifically associates with vimentin without accessory molecules. Kinesin binding to vimentin was not sensitive to {ATP}, and kinesin heads failed to bind to vimentin. By {SDS}-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a kinesin heavy chain of approximately 120 {kDa} and a light chain of approximately 64 {kDa} were detected in vimentin/kinesin pellets. The light chain reacted with a general kinesin light chain antibody, but not with two other antibodies that recognize the two known isoforms of kinesin light chain in brain, suggesting that the kinesin involved in binding to vimentin may be a specific one.

	abstract = {Summary
Microtubules undergo alternating periods of growth and shortening, known as dynamic instability. These dynamics allow microtubule plus ends to explore cellular space. The “search and capture” model posits that selective anchoring of microtubule plus ends at the cell cortex may contribute to cell polarization, spindle orientation, or targeted trafficking to specific cellular domains [1, 2, 3]. Whereas cytoplasmic dynein is primarily known as a minus-end-directed microtubule motor for organelle transport, cortically localized dynein has been shown to capture and tether microtubules at the cell periphery in both dividing and interphase cells [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. To explore the mechanism involved, we developed a minimal in vitro system, with dynein-bound beads positioned near microtubule plus ends using an optical trap. Dynein induced a significant reduction in the lateral diffusion of microtubule ends, distinct from the effects of other microtubule-associated proteins such as kinesin-1 and {EB}1. In assays with dynamic microtubules, dynein delayed barrier-induced catastrophe of microtubules. This effect was {ATP} dependent, indicating that dynein motor activity was required. Computational modeling suggests that dynein delays catastrophe by exerting tension on individual protofilaments, leading to microtubule stabilization. Thus, dynein-mediated capture and tethering of microtubules at the cortex can lead to enhanced stability of dynamic plus ends.},

	abstract = {Processivity, the ability of single molecules to move continuously along a track, is a fundamental requirement of cargo-transporting molecular motors. Here, we investigate how cytoplasmic dynein, a homodimeric, microtubule-based motor, achieves processive motion. To do this we developed a versatile method for assembling Saccharomyces cerevisiae dynein heterodimers using complementary {DNA} oligonucleotides covalently linked to dynein monomers labeled with different organic fluorophores. Using two-color, single-molecule microscopy and high-precision, two-dimensional tracking, we find dynein has a highly variable stepping pattern that is distinct from all other processive cytoskeletal motors, which use “hand-over-hand” mechanisms. Uniquely, dynein stepping is stochastic when its two motor domains are close together. However, coordination emerges as the distance between motor domains increases, implying a tension-based mechanism governs these steps. This plasticity may allow tuning of dynein for the diversity of cellular functions it performs.},
