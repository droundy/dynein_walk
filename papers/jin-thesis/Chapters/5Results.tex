Displacement is defined as the unbounded binding domain x position minus the binded binding domain x position, calculated before and after a step. Linear regression of the probability distribution indicates a dependence the final displacement of the step and its initial displacement, similarly to experiment. \textit{Bottom:} One dimensional probability density of step length. Step length defined as final displacement minus the initial displacement. Model compared to two experimental figures of stepping patterns from \citep{Dewitt2012}.}

\textit{Analysis on stepping patterns and what the parameters of our model indicate. Does dynein take a lot of fast steps?}

\section{Agree with Experiment?}
\textit{Whole point of parameter fitting was to agree with Yildiz and/or other experimental data. Did we do a good job?}
