\section{Simulation}
\textit{Picking Random angles to create random distribution of dynein configurations. Make sure to clarify that the simulation is split into two parts, the monte carlo both bound and brownian one bound. It is done this way in order for MC to generate ensemble of data rather quickly.}\\
\textit{Include a flow chart.}



\section{Time Evolution}
\textit{Simulate over a delta t during one bound and every iteration check for rebinding. How are the probabilities of binding and unbinding affected by the time.}

\section{Constants}
\textit{How we defined our constants based on experiment and pictures.  Need to include figures here of experiment dynein and how we measure the pre and post stroke equilibrium angles.}

\section{Parameter Fitting}
\textit{How we will fit our parameters to agree with Yildiz' experimental data of dynein stepping.}

\subsection{Rate Constants}
\textit{Fitting our rate constants were a huge part of our model and how we made sure our dynein can match experimentalist results.}

\section{Model Validation}
\textit{Any tests of our model to make sure the code is reasonably sound and that the physics makes sense. Make sure there is no bugs in code. What was the bug testing procedure.}
