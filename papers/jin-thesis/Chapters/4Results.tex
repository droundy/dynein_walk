  \caption{Optimized model parameters for following data sets. }
%  \caption{Parameters used in simulation. $c_b$, $c_m$ and $c_t$ are the MTBD, motor and tail spring constants, respectively. $k_b$ and $k_{ub}$ are the rates of pre-stroke to post-stroke and post-stroke to pre-stroke transitions, respectively. $L_s$ and $L_t$ are the lengths of the stalk and tail interdomain linkers. $c$ is the tension-gating factor. The $\theta$ values are the equilibrium values for each angle, where $\theta_m^{\mbox{pre}}$ is the equilibrium angle for the unbound motor in pre-stroke, whereas $\theta_m^{\mbox{post}}$ is the equilibrium angle for the bound pre-stroke motor and both post-stroke motors. $R_b$, $R_m$ and $R_t$ are the MTBD, motor and tail radii. Parameters used for all simulations unless otherwise noted}

After many trials, this combination of parameters best demonstrated the interstep correlation observed from Yildiz's experiment, while still preserving dynein's geometric constants. \textit{FIXME: Plots are wrong, need to fix and ask which plots to finalize}


\section{Stepping Patterns}
The plots that were used to compare with experiment and optimize our parameters are shown below
\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{/mc_plots/thesis_u_step_length_1d_probability_density_30.0_5.50e+09_1.00e+08_0.0_1.0_1.0_120.0_197.0_242.0_-0.5}
	\caption[Final Displacement Probability Distribution]{\textbf{Stepping Probability Distribution Plots.} \textit{Top:} Two dimensional heatmap of binding domain displacement before and after a stepping cycle. Linear regression of the probability distribution indicates a dependence between the final displacement of the step and its initial displacement. \textit{Bottom:} One dimensional probability density of step length. Step length defined as final displacement minus the initial displacement. Model compared to two experimental figures of stepping patterns from \citep{Dewitt2012}.} 
	\label{fig:DataStep}
\end{figure}
The first plot in Figure (\ref{fig:DataStep}) displayed the joint probability density of having a specific final displacement and initial displacement. The linear regression from experiment indicated the functionality between the two with an average final displacement of 9.1nm, indicated from the y-intercept. The second plot in Figure (\ref{fig:DataStep}) displayed the one-dimensional probability density of step lengths, defined as final displacement minus the initial displacement. The limitation of experiment was made very obvious here due to their inability to record short step lengths. This factor heavily influenced the parameter fitting because in order to best fit the linear correlation within steps, the model dynein had to take very fast and short steps. Since Yildiz observed a linear regression that averaged 0nm step lengths without being able to record 0nm, the model dynein was forced to take steps with very quick rebinding. The step lengths close to 0nm from Experiment Fig 3A in Figure (\ref{fig:DataStep}) were large step lengths in the off-axis. 

We fit the pre-exponential unbinding factor, $C$, based on experimental probability of having a trailing (lagging) step, as shown below

\textit{Need to include time plots and maybe more figures. Talk about the short time step.}

\section{Agree with Experiment?}
\textit{Whole point of parameter fitting was to agree with Yildiz and/or other experimental data. Did we do a good job? }

\textit{Need to eventually bring up the issue of being able to fit both the 2d hist linear regression and step length plot: If we want to fit linear regression, we must have short steps, but if we have short steps, the step length plot will not match at steps $>$ 20nm. Hard to agree with experiment when our dynein is forced to take short steps. Mention time too.}
