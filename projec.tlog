Keep accidentally erasing these! .log shouldn't get erased.

Anything over 5e-11 timestep goes under the MT. Perhaps this means a more rigid set of spring constants is necessary? Running a trial with dt=5e-10, c=[1,5,10,15,25,100]. Named: "high-dt-high-c"

It looks like high-c dt=3e-10 trials have "bad nmx" errors where some transitions generate NaNs. This seems especially so for high-c (c=50 or c=100) trials; low-c runs have MTBD-under-the-MT errors.

It looks like dt=1e-10 simulations don't have this issue. Low-c runs all seem to behave pretty well; high-c runs have NaN issues. Hopefully this is true for all such low-c simulations.

Generating a rate contour entitled "4-4-rate-square".

Lots of jobs quit due to sub-MT dynein. How to fix?? Should only show up on contour if the sim quit properly.

Looks like things are working! Running more simulations to explore the space.

4/11/17
"4-6-rate-square" was pretty good, lots of too-slow steps
"4-6-tiny-rate-square" was bad. Lots of NaNs were generated, which is odd - they should have been run at the same conditions as above, more or less.

4/12/17
All current onebound points in 4-12-contour are too low. Going to try some much lower kbs..."4-12-low-kb", kb=[1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1, 1, 10, 100] kub=[1e9, 1e10, 1e11, 1e12]

Make a new directory called data/final-params with the updated parameters, since Ls/Lt were switched in the previous month of sims. Re-exploring the space iteratively.
