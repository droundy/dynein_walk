# Dynein ToDo List 

## John

1. Try longer tail (widen displacement distribution) 
2. Increase binding rate (look for initial vs final correlation) 
3. add histogram plot to paper (overlaid histogram) 
4. Look into log-scale of bb time histogram in paper (are the bins really log scaled?)
5. add average tail/motor domain displacements to stepping data output 
6. add Ls & Lt to dynein run parameters. 
7. Finish dynein.run script 
8. Create params dictionary files in ./data for simulations 
9. Fix plotting scripts to search for file names based on params files. 

## Jin 

1. Work with the rust code
