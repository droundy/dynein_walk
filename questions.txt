-To calculate d_mlx (get_d_mlx) I use d/dx (blx + ls*cos(bla)) = dblx + -ls*sin(bla)*d_bla. However, d_bla is calculated with other angle velocities (d_mla,mra,bra) in it already. Is this double-counting velocities?

-How should I make a dynein init file?

Todo:
use \left and \right parenthesis instead of \Big (
Get rid of excess *s
Operator at beginning of line, not end
Make equals more obvious by adding newlines
Turn fractions of X/Ys into
