Things to do:

-Find way to clear up far-binding vs free-binding naming problem in dynein_struct

-Solve matrix (ideally not using Mathematica, or at least start it out w/o Mathematica)

-------------------

* Find a way to get equilibrium angles of pre/post-powerstroke states.

* Equilibrium angle thoughts:

  - Two motor domain angles: bound angle + free angle (assume
    instantaneous chemistry).  Hopefully assume just one stiffness for
    the motor domain.

    This could be four motor domain angles if symmetry is violated,
    but there seems no need.  We don't think there is!

  - Just one tail angle, possibly with zero torque as a
    simplification.  Or maybe with a zero value for equilibrium angle
    to represent symmetry.  One tail stiffness (which could be zero).

  - One or two binding angles depending on our symmetry.  Let's just
    say one binding angle for now and keep things symmetric.  We also
    need a stiffness here ("ankle strength").

Eventually:

* Make movie files.
