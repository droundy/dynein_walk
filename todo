Things to do:

* Implement both-bound case!

* Look up structure of dynein (maybe copying figures) to estimate
  lengths and angles and gammas (radii of "spheres").

* Rename left and right to bound and free.

* Implement smart binding code?

* Make plotting prettier
  - Look more like dynein...at least make motor domain dots larger than
    binding dots
    
  - Somehow make "right" side of molecule look closer than left?

* Equilibrium angle thoughts:

  - Two motor domain angles: bound angle + free angle (assume
    instantaneous chemistry).  Hopefully assume just one stiffness for
    the motor domain.

    This could be four motor domain angles if symmetry is violated,
    but there seems no need.  We don't think there is!

  - Just one tail angle, possibly with zero torque as a
    simplification.  Or maybe with a zero value for equilibrium angle
    to represent symmetry.  One tail stiffness (which could be zero).

  - One or two binding angles depending on our symmetry.  Let's just
    say one binding angle for now and keep things symmetric.  We also
    need a stiffness here ("ankle strength").

Eventually:

* Support stepping and walking...

* Make movie files.
