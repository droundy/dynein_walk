Things to do:

* Make internal forces "forces" member, not a bunch of float members for forces

* Make internal forces test case a "forces" member, not an enum
  (Requires updating tests)

* Make equilibrium angles a member of dynein_struct, and an input to
  constructor.
  (Requires updating tests and enables new tests of internal forces)

* Look up structure of dynein (maybe copying figures) to estimate
  lengths and angles.

* Make code support multiple gamma values for binding, motor, tail.
  Estimate these.


EVENTUALLY:

* Support stepping and walking...

* Make movie files.
