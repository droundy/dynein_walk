<h1> Dynein To-do List </h1>


<h3> John </h3>
<ol>
    <li>Try running with longer tail i.e. bigger Lt (widen displacement distribution) </li>
    <li>Increase binding rate (look for initial vs final correlation)</li>
    <li>add histogram plot to paper (overlaid histogram)</li>
    <li>Look into log-scale of the bb time histogram in paper (are the bins really log scaled?)</li>
    <li>add average tail/motor domain displacements to stepping data output</li>
    <li>add Ls & Lt to dynein run parameters.</li>
    <li><strike>Finish dynein.run script</strike></li>
    <li>Create params dictionary files in ./data for simulations</li>
    <ul>
        <li><strike>create best parameters file (params.py)</strike> </li>
        <li>Create params file for only onebound (called angle something...) </li>
        <li> Verify correct best params between paper_params.py and script defaults. </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Fix plotting scripts to search for file names bsaed on params files.</li>
    <li>For the both bound state (calculate Total energy as function of two angles). Make color plot of energy as a function of the two angles. Do this with Jin. <b>Highlight the equilibrium value slices in the plot. Plot should also be a function of the initial displacement between the feet.</b> We can call it "Energy Landscape" or something to that effect. </li>
</ol>
