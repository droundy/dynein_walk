<h1> Dynein To-do List </h1>

<hr>

<h3> John </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Try running with longer tail i.e. bigger Lt (widen displacement distribution) </li>
        <li>Increase binding rate (look for initial vs final correlation)</li>
        <li>add histogram plot to paper (overlaid histogram)</li>
        <li>Look into log-scale of the bb time histogram in paper (are the bins really log scaled?)</li>
        <li>add average tail/motor domain displacements to stepping data output</li>
        <li><strike>Finish dynein.run script</strike></li>
        <li>Create params dictionary files in ./data for simulations</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strike>create best parameters file (params.py)</strike> </li>
            <li>Create params file for only onebound (called angle something...) </li>
            <li> Verify correct best params between paper_params.py and script defaults. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Fix plotting scripts to search for file names bsaed on params files.</li>
    </ol>

<h4>Notes from colloquium: Kazu Oiwa </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Double check that each binding domain has equal probability of unbinding independently</li>
        <li>Find Kazu Oiwa Nature Nanotech Paper (ask David)</li>
        <li>Look for Jim Spudich lab paper on myosin 5/6 Brownian motion resolution on unbinding using gold nanoparticles for scattering measurements. Suggested by Kazu</li>
        <li> Add description of how our model "breaks the symmetry" as David mentioned after colloqium. i.e. the exponential unbinding rate formula and the pre/post powerstoke equilibrium angles.</li>
    </ol>

<h3> Jin </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            (For fun) Make addition to bb_energy_distribution.py to highlight equilibrium angles on graph
        </li>
    </ol>


<h3>Thoughts / Ideas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If we add in the periodic structure of the microtubule to our model (i.e. we only accept steps sizes of multiples of 8 nm) we could try and see how chirality of microtubule induces minus end directed motion. Start with some initial configuration and the have the x positions of the possible binding sites to be slightly skewed between each of the two binding domains to account for the helicity of the MT</li>
    </ul>
